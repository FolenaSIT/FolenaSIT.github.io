    <h2>Niigata - February 2024</h2>
        <p>Even though i'm in Japan since September, i only started visiting another places in the start of 2024. This is my first trip outside Tokyo, i went snowboarding on Niigata mountains for 3 days</p>
        <p>At the start, it was really hard to snowboard, since i never did this, because Brazil does not have snow. But it was really fun learning how to balance on the board.</p>
        <p>After 2 days struggling with, i managed to decently snowboard my ways through the mountains, it was a awesome experience. If i have the opportunity to snowboardagain, i will surely go!</p>

        <p>This photo was taken in the last day, i took the ropeway to another montain and i got to see this amazing view, after looking at it, i saw that my trip was worth it</p>

    <h2>Hiroshima - February/March 2024</h2>
        <p>This trip started at the same month i went to Niigata, but this time i went with my parents, thry decided to come to Japan and get to know the country, it was a trip of 8 days, i could not see much places, but the time i spent with my parents was something that i needed at the moment.</p>
        <p>The first place me and my parents visted was <strong>Hiroshima</strong>, we took a Shinkansen from Tokyo station from all the way to Hiroshima, since our time was really short, we went to the goltel and left our luggages. The first place we visited was bombing center in 1945.</p>
            <img src="src/img/Hiroshima1.jpeg" alt="Hiroshima" style="width: 400px;height: 450px;padding-left: 10px;">
        <p>This place was the place where the bomb fell on that day, it used to be the <strong>Hiroshima Prefectural Products Display Hall</strong>, where it used to sell products from Hiroshima prefecture, but after the bombing, it changed it's name to "Atomic Bomb Dome".</p>
        <p>It was sad visiting the Bomb memorial, i did not took any pictures, but i felt a sad sensation walking though the place and seeing the remains and the histories of people who lost their loved ones by this tragic event.</p>
            <img src="src/img/Hiroshima2.jpeg" alt="Hiroshima2" style="width: 500px;height: 350px;padding-left: 10px;">
        <p>After seeing some sad images, me and my parents went for a walk, then we saw the Hiroshima castle, so we decided to enter, since i had some classes about castles on the last semester, i got interested in the castle, in which way it was built, since it had a bridge, it could help in possible enemy invasions, since this castle was a economical center of the city.</p>
