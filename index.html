                <p>Living in Japan since Semptember 2023, i have had a lot of experiences during this period i'm here, meeting new people, meeting new places and trying new kinds of foods.</p>
                <p>In the moment i work in a part-time job in a Brazillian Restaurant called Barbacoa, i have the role of a Passador, this means i serve clients meat we do on the grill. Even this job being exhausting, i like it because i can practice my japanese.</p>
                <p>My main reason to come to Japan, besides the exchange program, is my love for the culture and the medias that are made in Japan, such as Animes, Games and Musics.</p>

        <!--<h2>Animes</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
                <p>One of my main reasons I came to Japan was because of anime. I always wanted to see the places the animes are situated, so when my university told me about the exchange program, I got excited to visit Japan.</p>
                <p>a</p>
                <p>My favourite animes are: Konosuba, Nichijou, Summertime Rendering and Bocchi The Rock</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
                <p>I always listened to every kind of music, but the genre that i most listen is <strong> Vocaloid music, J-pop and Lo-fi</strong>. It is very normal to see me with earphones every time and everywhere listening to some music. I really like to listen to music on the train or while doing some work, like coding, i feel i can get more productive while listening to some music that i really like.</p>
                <p>Since i arrived in Japan, i tried to go on some concerts of the bands that i like, but the only concerts i was able to go until now is Wagakki Band and a event called Japam Jam, where a lot of artists go and play around 10 musics, thanks to this event i was able to see one of the bands that i really like, called <strong>Atarashii Gakko!</strong>. In the month of June i will be going to a concert made by the creators of <strong>Persona</strong>, where they play some songs of the game.</p>

                <p>My inspiraion to start cosplaying was in 2020, when I went to my first anime event and saw the cosplayers having fun and making friends, so i decided to try cosplaying, and after my first event, I felt so happy for being able to make friends and get to know people doing something that i like.</p>
                <p>In Japan, i went to Comiket, which is one of the biggest anime events in Japan, then i went the two days in cosplay, i got to talk with a lot of cosplayer, which one of them was with the exact cosplay as me, so i talked with him for a long time and we both took a photo to keep as a good memory.</p>

        <p>I know a little of Java, but I can't be familiarized with this programming language, since i feel that this language is more complex to utilize.</p>
